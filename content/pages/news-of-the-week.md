Each project team will be assigned by the TA to present the News of the Week once during the term. The main objective of the News of the Week assignment is to broaden the perspectives of the students in the class, keeping them up-to-date on the latest developments related to pharmaceuticals that are covered in the news media. We aim for students to develop insights into the implications of the various happenings for public policy and business strategy. News within the following topics may be covered:

- Research Milestones or Developments
- Industry News
- Policy News
- Product Developments
- Corporate News

The above are suggested topic areas; the team should feel free to share any news outside of the topics, but relevant to the News of the Week assignment. We are not, however, requesting that you choose subjects that relate to your project topic. The presentations should be no more than 20 minutes during which the team presents a summary of each news item, its importance (how it relates to any of the class topics), its implications (broadly, at the micro and macro levels) and any brief analysis, insights, and viewpoints.

This assignment is very open ended. Some students choose to provide a survey of multiple articles while others prefer to focus on only one or two topics. It may be relevant to supplement a particular news item with contextual information relevant previous research, but this is not required. Please keep in mind that the main objective of this exercise is to bring noteworthy news items to the attention of your classmates, to consider the implications of these topics, and to make connections to topics being covered in class.

## Sample News Articles

Below are sample news articles presented in the Fall 2013 class.
