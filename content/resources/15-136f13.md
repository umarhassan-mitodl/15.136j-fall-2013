  caption: An example of a dose-response curve which shows how much of a drug causes
    a particular effect or side effect in the body (Crabtree + Company, {{% resource_link

  image-alt: Two dose-response curves showing different amounts of a drug on the x-axis,
    and effect on the body on the y-axis. The resulting curves for "desired effect"
    and "side effect" both have a steep slope with a slight "S" shape before leveling
    off at the top.
